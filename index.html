 <h1>Welcome to the Soldaat Homepage</h1>  
 <p>I'm tired of the liars, I'm tired of the games
I'm tired of everythin' that don't quite feel the same
Gi-gi-girl, I got that fire but with me, it ain't the same
Now I could make you famous, put you in a mansion
The designer, the frames
Money ain't a problem, money ain't a thing
All my danny's poppin', impossible to stop us from doin' our thing
I'm tired of the talkers, I'm tired of the fakes
I'm tired of anyone who thinks they all mean the same
I-I-I be poppin' bottles, sparkles and champagne
VIP my section, Royalty lookin' sexy, you know that be my bae
I'm tired of the liars, I'm tired of the games
I'm tired of everythin' that don't quite feel the same
Gi-gi-girl, I got that fire but with me, it ain't the same
Now I could make you famous, put you in a mansion
The designer, the frames
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could get you right, I could put you on a flight
We could roll the dice, maybe you could spend the night
"SCE" for life, I be sharper than a knife
Chicken with the rice, motor with the loud pipes
Prezzi with the ice diamond, shine without a light
I got a question, how is you poppin', but don't got a section?
Look at the blessin', the way that I am winnin', you know I ain't stressin'
I'm just finessin', ridin' the B like I'm ridin' a jet ski
I flip it, I flip it, I flip it, I whip it, I whip it, I whip it
Speedin' and shit, I got a ticket, catch a flight, and I'm right in yo' city
She cryin', she all in her feelings, I had it up to the ceilin'
We can't be actin' like children
I'm tired of the liars, I'm tired of the games
I'm tired of everythin' that don't quite feel the same
Gi-gi-girl, I got that fire but with me, it ain't the same
Now I could make you famous, put you in a mansion
The designer, the frames
I'm tired of the liars, I'm tired of the games
I'm tired of everythin' that don't quite feel the same
Gi-gi-girl, I got that fire but with me, it ain't the same
Now I could make you famous, put you in a mansion
The designer, the frames
I'm tired of the liars, I'm tired of the games
Oh, Lord, oh, nah-nah-nah
Oh, Lord, oh, nah-nah-nah
Oh, Lord, oh, nah-nah-nah</p>
